### What do I want to learn or understand better?
We've decided to develop an app for Android, so I have to do a lot of research about this, since I've never developed an android application.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I think i can help a lot when it comes to the backend service and database development, also in constructing our docker containers
and docker-compose definition.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Helped with the sprint planning and creation of epics, stories and tasks for the upcoming sprint.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

We all worked together to create the project plan and on the planning for the first sprint.
